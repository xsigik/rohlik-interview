# Example React project

Create a simple React app with Next.js and TypeScript, other libraries (like component library) are up to you.

## Requirements:

- one dashboard page which loads products.json asynchronously, e.g. via fetch()  from public folder or from API route
- products are displayed in a grid (css grid / flex)
- products can be filtered by name using the search field
- each product card has buttons "add" and "remove" from the cart
- the state of the cart is persisted into window.localStorage
- to submit your code use Github, Gitlab, CodeSandbox, Stackblitz etc.
